Python toolbox to transform zebrafish tracking data to tail animations

## Description
`zf_animator` is a Python package used to create visualisation of how swimming data looks from high-speed tracking data.
The typical data used should be the tail angle along segments of the tail.
The package will convert these tail angles to x- y- coordinates, and interpolate many more points along the range of tracked tail segments.
These sets of coordinates will then transform slices of the zebrafish image, producing a stack of .png files that can be rendered into an mp4 file.
